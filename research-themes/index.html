<p>In Phase 1, C-DEBI researchers described the hydrologic, geochemical, and microbial connectivity within the crust on a kilometer scale; quantified the transfer and fate of solutes between the ocean, sediment, and subseafloor basalt; and located and sampled the first known site of massive, low-temperature hydrothermal discharge on a ridge flank. In Phase 2, we will build on these achievements and focus on processes that control the movement of mass, heat, solutes, genetic material, and microbial cells within the deep subseafloor, and between this realm and the overlying ocean.</p>

<p>C-DEBI researchers were also the first to quantify energy yields of metabolic reactions and redox fluxes in deep sediment. In Phase 2, we will investigate the composition and distribution of electron acceptors, electron donors, and organic matter at new sites to evaluate in situ geochemical energy sources for microbial metabolism.</p>

<p>Studies will test interpretations and hypotheses put forth in Phase 1 that often relied on sparse data. This scaling up by expanding existing and integrating new datasets, will allow us to generate regional and global maps and models of the subseafloor geochemistry and hydrology, and place potential microbial metabolisms in a broader context.</p>

<p>Themes 1 and 2 focus on subseafloor ecosystems, but many of the unique properties of the resident biota can best be investigated in the laboratory with model organisms or consortia. Theme 3 is therefore directed at examining the potential physiological, metabolic, and survival strategies employed under subseafloor conditions, including low energy flux and low or zero growth rates. It is highly likely that subseafloor microorganisms harbor fundamental traits that differ significantly from those of their faster-growing, laboratory-adapted counterparts. Uncovering the biochemical and genetic bases of those differences will inform our understanding of fundamental physiological processes of subseafloor microbes. Specifically, we will use selected model organisms to begin testing hypotheses generated from our field and <em>in situ</em> observations. While we fully recognize the limitations of culture-based systems to replicate natural environments, data from laboratory systems that are modified to specifically investigate unique aspects of subseafloor microbial life can serve as useful proxies for specific physiological aspects of such microbes in situ. An organism’s metabolic capabilities in the laboratory guide and constrain our understanding of its ability to adapt to specific environmental conditions. Theme 3 builds on and complements the large and growing database of microbial community structure and metagenomic data from diverse subseafloor environments. By studying model subseafloor organisms in the laboratory, we expect to gain important, novel, and basic insights into physiological and metabolic features that are unique to microbes in the subseafloor. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:</p>

<p>Our three themes are highly complementary and intimately coupled. For example, fluxes of solutes and available energy sources (Theme 1) will inform on potential metabolic activities (Theme 2), which will be targeted in controlled laboratory experiments with model organisms (Theme 3), with the resulting data serving as input parameters for coupled models of subseafloor ecosystems (back to Theme 1). While feedback loops between themes are evident throughout, the order in which the themes are presented is not arbitrary; the founding constraints for microbial life in subseafloor environments are the underlying physical and chemical processes (Theme 1) within which microbial communities persist and build ecosystems (Theme 2), where individual microbial cells exhibit physiological and genetic traits characteristic for life at low energy fluxes and low growth rates (Theme 3).</p>
