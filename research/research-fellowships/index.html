<p><a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIFellowshipProgram_2016b.docx">DOC version of the 2016 C-DEBI Fellowship Program Guidelines <strong>WITH WORDING UPDATES</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="program-objective">Program Objective<a class="headerlink" href="#program-objective" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>C-DEBI provides support for graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships awarded on the basis of scientific excellence and the appropriateness of the subject matter to Center objectives. The goal of the fellowship program is to stimulate the advancement of deep biosphere research through the training of a new generation of innovative scientists. Potential fellows should contact and discuss research topics for fellowships with potential advisors, as successful candidates will be expected to have well-conceived research plans as well as willing advisors. C-DEBI values a diverse research environment and encourages proposals from applicants who would help to improve diversity in C-DEBI and STEM fields.</p>
<h3 id="proposal-parameters">Proposal Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-parameters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Fellowship proponents are invited to respond to the <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/research-support/research-grants/">annual research call</a> with proposals that will significantly advance C-DEBI's central research agenda: to investigate the subseafloor biosphere deep in sediments and the volcanic crust, and to conduct multi-disciplinary studies to develop an integrated understanding of subseafloor microbial life at the molecular, cellular, and ecosystem scales. Phase 2 of C-DEBI comprises a transition from dominantly exploration-based investigations to projects that balance discovery with hypothesis testing, data integration and synthesis, and ecosystem modeling.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each fellowship applicant will identify a primary advisor, who agrees to sponsor them and manage logistical aspects of their support (office and lab space, materials and supplies for conducting research). The graduate fellowship applicant must be a student in good standing who has been accepted into a graduate program. The primary advisor of all graduate student and postdoctoral fellows will be required to commit to meeting with the fellow to discuss research progress at least twice monthly and to provide means of allowing broader discussion about her or his research – this can be in the form of departmental seminars, group meetings, etc.</p>
<p>The primary advisor is also required to provide support for the fellow to attend an appropriate national meeting (e.g., AGU, ASM, ISME, ASLO, ISSM). Fellows are encouraged to go to the <a href="http://www.agu.org/meetings/">Fall American Geophysical Union (AGU) Meeting</a> in San Francisco as this is the major meeting that many C-DEBI participants attend. Fellows are expected to attend annual <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/research-activities/annual-meetings/">C-DEBI meetings</a> supported directly by C-DEBI. <em>The advisor should include a statement agreeing to these points in their recommendation letter.</em></p>
<p class="also">See our <a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/C-DEBIMentoringPlan_2015.pdf">graduate student and postdoctoral mentoring plan</a><br /></p>
<h3 id="duration-and-renewal">Duration and Renewal<a class="headerlink" href="#duration-and-renewal" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We anticipate successful proposals to start 4/1/16 in alignment with our funding periodicity, however a delayed start date for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships is possible and will be a consideration in the review process. Graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships are available for a maximum of 2 years, depending on a successful evaluation near the end of year 1 of the fellowship. Fellows will submit a progress report on their achievements (2 pages maximum including any presentations given or papers published that can be listed separately), a one page summary of the proposed work for the second year and a letter of progress from the advisor to an ad-hoc oversight committee whose approval will be required for the release of the second year of fellowship funding.</p>
