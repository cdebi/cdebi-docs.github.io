In the context of proposal review, a CoI would include (but may not be limited to): being employed by the same institution, having a history of student/postdoctoral-advisor relationship, having had a personal (romantic or familial) relationship, being a recent (in the past five years) co-author on a publication or a co-PI on a recent proposal. In addition, members of a review panel who have a CoI with a proposal under review may not be part of conversations in which that proposal is evaluated or discussed. If proposals are to be ranked, a panel member with a CoI will not be permitted to rank a conflicted proposal.\n\n\nEthical Misconduct Resolution\n\n\nMembers of the C-DEBI community (both USC- and non-USC-based \nmembers\n) have two avenues for resolving a situation of potential ethical misconduct. The first avenue is to openly raise a complaint to the Ethics Panel. The second avenue allows the person raising the issue to remain anonymous to the C-DEBI community by calling the USC ethics hotline (\nhttp://ooc.usc.edu/help-hotline\n) and describing the problem. The USC Office of Compliance will then contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel without identifying the person who supplied the information. The \nEthics\n Panel will then work with the C-DEBI Executive Committee to resolve the situation. Any further contact with the \noriginal contact person\n \ncomplainant\n will use the Office of Compliance as an intermediary.\n\n\nSee \nCurrent Members of the C-DEBI Ethics Panel\n\n\nExample Scenario\n\n\nA student notices that her PhD advisor has knowingly placed figures and data produced by one of her advisor's previous postdocs into a new publication. There is no attribution in the authorship, acknowledgments, or citations for the postdoc\u2019s work. The postdoc's research had been funded by a C-DEBI fellowship. The student would like to take action against this ethical misconduct. However, she does not want to be identified to anyone else in the C-DEBI community, or to her advisor. So, the student looks on the C-DEBI website and finds the number for the USC hotline. She calls it, explains her evidence to them, and then they contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel naming the advisor, but giving no information about the person who supplied the information.\u00a0The C-DEBI Ethics Panel discusses the complaint, and deems it worthy of further discussion with the Executive Committee. Together, the two committees agree that further clarification on the ethical complaint is necessary, so they contact the USC Office of Compliance to get further information from the student.",

In Phase 2, we will build on these achievements and focus on processes that control the movement of mass, heat, solutes, genetic material, and microbial cells within the deep subseafloor, and between this realm and the overlying ocean.\n\n\n(1.2)  Map the geochemical energy sources in subseafloor ecosystems at a range of spatial scales.\n\n\nC-DEBI researchers were also the first to quantify energy yields of metabolic reactions and redox fluxes in deep sediment. In Phase 2, we will investigate the composition and distribution of electron acceptors, electron donors, and organic matter at new sites to evaluate in situ geochemical energy sources for microbial metabolism.\n\n\n(1.3)  Develop and test the next generation of coupled geochemical-hydrological-microbial models for subseafloor ecosystems.\n\n\nStudies will test interpretations and hypotheses put forth in Phase 1 that often relied on sparse data. This scaling up by expanding existing and integrating new datasets, will allow us to generate regional and global maps and models of the subseafloor geochemistry and hydrology, and place potential microbial metabolisms in a broader context.\n\n\nTheme 2: Activities, Communities, and Ecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Emphasizing resident microbial communities\n\n\n\n\nField work, in situ activity measurements, stable isotope probing, and various \u201comics\u201d approaches will take center stage.\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n(2.1) Determine community composition, functional potential, and patterns of natural selection in subseafloor ecosystems\n\n\nIn Phase 1, C-DEBI researchers determined microbial community composition in samples from several subseafloor environments; carried out the first transcriptomic study of a subseafloor ecosystem. we will build on these results to understand community structure and its drivers in subseafloor ecosystems.\n\n\n(2.2) Determine metabolic activity of subseafloor microbial communities\n\n\nIn Phase 1, C-DEBI researchers undertook some of the first studies of metabolic potential in subseafloor ecosystems; quantified energy yields of metabolic reactions and redox fluxes in deep subseafloor systems. We will investigate functional potential and microbial activities to understand how energy and nutrients are transformed in subseafloor environments.\n\n\n(2.3) Advance understanding of subseafloor microbe-virus interactions.\n\n\nLastly, we will integrate these studies of community composition and microbial activities to test hypotheses of natural selection in the subseafloor.\n\n\nTheme 3: Metabolism, Survival, and Adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Concentrating on the actions and traits of individual microbial species\n\n\n\n\nThemes 1 and 2 focus on subseafloor ecosystems, but many of the unique properties of the resident biota can best be investigated in the laboratory with model organisms or consortia. Theme 3 is therefore directed at examining the potential physiological, metabolic, and survival strategies employed under subseafloor conditions, including low energy flux and low or zero growth rates. It is highly likely that subseafloor microorganisms harbor fundamental traits that differ significantly from those of their faster-growing, laboratory-adapted counterparts. Uncovering the biochemical and genetic bases of those differences will inform our understanding of fundamental physiological processes of subseafloor microbes. Specifically, we will use selected model organisms to begin testing hypotheses generated from our field and \nin situ\n observations. While we fully recognize the limitations of culture-based systems to replicate natural environments, data from laboratory systems that are modified to specifically investigate unique aspects of subseafloor microbial life can serve as useful proxies for specific physiological aspects of such microbes in situ. An organism\u2019s metabolic capabilities in the laboratory guide and constrain our understanding of its ability to adapt to specific environmental conditions. Theme 3 builds on and complements the large and growing database of microbial community structure and metagenomic data from diverse subseafloor environments. By studying model subseafloor organisms in the laboratory, we expect to gain important, novel, and basic insights into physiological and metabolic features that are unique to microbes in the subseafloor. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:\n\n\n(3.1) Isolate and characterize novel bacteria and archaea from diverse subseafloor habitats.\n\n\n(3.2) Examine fundamental physiology of subseafloor microbes under conditions of low growth rates and low energy flux.\n\n\n(3.3) Perform adaptive evolution and long-term survival experiments with subseafloor microbes to characterize molecular genetic signatures associated with particular phenotypes.\n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nOur three themes are highly complementary and intimately coupled. For example, fluxes of solutes and available energy sources (Theme 1) will inform on potential metabolic activities (Theme 2), which will be targeted in controlled laboratory experiments with model organisms (Theme 3), with the resulting data serving as input parameters for coupled models of subseafloor ecosystems (back to Theme 1). While feedback loops between themes are evident throughout, the order in which the themes are presented is not arbitrary; the founding constraints for microbial life in subseafloor environments are the underlying physical and chemical processes (Theme 1) within which microbial communities persist and build ecosystems (Theme 2), where individual microbial cells exhibit physiological and genetic traits characteristic for life at low energy fluxes and low growth rates (Theme 3).\n\n\nSee more details on these themes in the \nC-DEBI renewal proposal",

These programs use C-DEBI resources to leverage other funding and opportunities.\n\n\n\u00bb See opportunities for\u00a0\nC-DEBI research support",
