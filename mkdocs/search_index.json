We will quantify transfers of fluid, heat, solutes, carbon, and microbes within and between subseafloor biomes, and between the subseafloor and the overlying ocean; determine the nature of energy sources available to microbes in these ecosystems; and develop the next generation of coupled fluid-energy-biochemical-microbial models.\n\n\nTheme 2: Activities, Communities, and Ecosystems\n emphasizes resident microbial communities. We aim to illuminate the composition of subseafloor microbial communities and the functional potential of these communities, based on the diversity of metabolic activities and interactions with the physicochemical aspects of the system.\n\n\nTheme 3: Metabolism, Survival, and Adaptation\n concentrates on the actions and traits of individual microbial species. We will build a \u2018portfolio\u2019 of selected model subseafloor organisms and characterize their physiological and genetic traits. These microorganisms will be used to investigate energy and carbon use for growth and maintenance under kinetically limiting conditions and to determine rates of metabolism under specific conditions.\n\n\nOur three themes are highly complementary and intimately coupled. For example, fluxes of solutes and available energy sources (Theme 1) will inform on potential metabolic activities (Theme 2), which will be targeted in controlled laboratory experiments with model organisms (Theme 3), with the resulting data serving as input parameters for coupled models of subseafloor ecosystems (back to Theme 1).\n\n\nWhile feedback loops between themes are evident throughout, the order in which the themes are presented is not arbitrary; the founding constraints for microbial life in subseafloor environments are the underlying physical and chemical processes (Theme 1) within which microbial communities persist and build ecosystems (Theme 2), where individual microbial cells exhibit physiological and genetic traits characteristic for life at low energy fluxes and low growth rates (Theme 3).\n\n\nTheme 1: Fluxes, Connectivity, and Energy\n\n\n\u2014 centering on subseafloor environmental conditions\n\n\nIn Phase 1, C-DEBI researchers described the hydrologic, geochemical, and microbial connectivity within the crust on a kilometer scale; quantified the transfer and fate of solutes between the ocean, sediment, and subseafloor basalt; and located and sampled the first known site of massive, low-temperature hydrothermal discharge on a ridge flank. C-DEBI researchers were also the first to quantify energy yields of metabolic reactions and redox fluxes in deep sediment.\n\n\nIn Phase 2, we will build on these achievements and focus on processes that control the movement of mass, heat, solutes, genetic material, and microbial cells within the deep subseafloor, and between this realm and the overlying ocean. We will also investigate the composition and distribution of electron acceptors, electron donors, and organic matter at new sites to evaluate in situ geochemical energy sources for microbial metabolism. Studies will test interpretations and hypotheses put forth in Phase 1 that often relied on sparse data. This scaling up by expanding existing and integrating new datasets, will allow us to generate regional and global maps and models of the subseafloor geochemistry and hydrology, and place potential microbial metabolisms in a broader context.\n\n\nKey research components in Theme 1 include multidisciplinary exploration, collection of field data, metabolic energy calculations, and coupled modeling of linked conditions and fluxes. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:\n\n\n\n\n(1.1)\n \nConstrain the extent, variability, and controls on fluxes and connectivity within subseafloor biomes and between the subseafloor and the overlying ocean\n\n\n(1.2)\n   \nMap the geochemical energy sources in subseafloor ecosystems at a range of spatial scales\n\n\n(1.3)\n   \nDevelop and test the next generation of coupled geochemical-hydrological-microbial models for subseafloor ecosystems\n\n\n\n\nTheme 2: Activities, Communities, and Ecosystems\n\n\n\u2014 emphasizing resident microbial communities\n\n\nIn Phase 1, C-DEBI researchers a) determined microbial community composition in samples from several subseafloor environments, b) undertook some of the first studies of metabolic potential in subseafloor ecosystems, c) carried out the first transcriptomic study of a subseafloor ecosystem, and d) quantified energy yields of metabolic reactions and redox fluxes in deep subseafloor systems.\n\n\nIn Phase 2, we will build on these results to understand community structure and its drivers in subseafloor ecosystems. We will document the genetic composition of subseafloor communities and investigate functional potential and microbial activities to understand how energy and nutrients are transformed in subseafloor environments. Lastly, we will integrate these studies of community composition and microbial activities to test hypotheses of natural selection in the subseafloor.\n\n\nField work, \nin situ\n activity measurements, stable isotope probing, and various \u201comics\u201d approaches will take center stage, with these main research objectives:\n\n\n\n\n(2.1)\n \nDetermine community composition, functional potential, and patterns of natural selection in subseafloor ecosystems\n\n\n(2.2)\n \nDetermine metabolic activity of subseafloor microbial communities\n\n\n(2.3)\n \nAdvance understanding of subseafloor microbe-virus interactions\n\n\n\n\nTheme 3: Metabolism, Survival, and Adaptation\n\n\n- concentrating on the actions and traits of individual microbial species\n\n\nThemes 1 and 2 focus on subseafloor ecosystems, but many of the unique properties of the resident biota can best be investigated in the laboratory with model organisms or consortia. Theme 3 is therefore directed at examining the potential physiological, metabolic, and survival strategies employed under subseafloor conditions, including low energy flux and low or zero growth rates. It is highly likely that subseafloor microorganisms harbor fundamental traits that differ significantly from those of their faster-growing, laboratory-adapted counterparts. Uncovering the biochemical and genetic bases of those differences will inform our understanding of fundamental physiological processes of subseafloor microbes.\n\n\nSpecifically, we will use selected model organisms to begin testing hypotheses generated from our field and \nin situ\n observations. While we fully recognize the limitations of culture-based systems to replicate natural environments, data from laboratory systems that are modified to specifically investigate unique aspects of subseafloor microbial life can serve as useful proxies for specific physiological aspects of such microbes in situ. An organism\u2019s metabolic capabilities in the laboratory guide and constrain our understanding of its ability to adapt to specific environmental conditions.\n\n\nTheme 3 builds on and complements the large and growing database of microbial community structure and metagenomic data from diverse subseafloor environments. By studying model subseafloor organisms in the laboratory, we expect to gain important, novel, and basic insights into physiological and metabolic features that are unique to microbes in the subseafloor. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:\n\n\n\n\n(3.1)\n \nIsolate and characterize novel bacteria and archaea from diverse subseafloor habitats.\n\n\n(3.2)\n \nExamine fundamental physiology of subseafloor microbes under conditions of low growth rates and low energy flux.\n\n\n(3.3)\n \nPerform adaptive evolution and long-term survival experiments with subseafloor microbes to characterize molecular genetic signatures associated with particular phenotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about our Research Themes, see the \nC-DEBI renewal proposal",

In Phase 2, we will build on these achievements and focus on processes that control the movement of mass, heat, solutes, genetic material, and microbial cells within the deep subseafloor, and between this realm and the overlying ocean. We will also investigate the composition and distribution of electron acceptors, electron donors, and organic matter at new sites to evaluate in situ geochemical energy sources for microbial metabolism. Studies will test interpretations and hypotheses put forth in Phase 1 that often relied on sparse data. This scaling up by expanding existing and integrating new datasets, will allow us to generate regional and global maps and models of the subseafloor geochemistry and hydrology, and place potential microbial metabolisms in a broader context.  Key research components in Theme 1 include multidisciplinary exploration, collection of field data, metabolic energy calculations, and coupled modeling of linked conditions and fluxes. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:   (1.1)   Constrain the extent, variability, and controls on fluxes and connectivity within subseafloor biomes and between the subseafloor and the overlying ocean  (1.2)     Map the geochemical energy sources in subseafloor ecosystems at a range of spatial scales  (1.3)     Develop and test the next generation of coupled geochemical-hydrological-microbial models for subseafloor ecosystems",

Theme 3 is therefore directed at examining the potential physiological, metabolic, and survival strategies employed under subseafloor conditions, including low energy flux and low or zero growth rates. It is highly likely that subseafloor microorganisms harbor fundamental traits that differ significantly from those of their faster-growing, laboratory-adapted counterparts. Uncovering the biochemical and genetic bases of those differences will inform our understanding of fundamental physiological processes of subseafloor microbes.  Specifically, we will use selected model organisms to begin testing hypotheses generated from our field and  in situ  observations. While we fully recognize the limitations of culture-based systems to replicate natural environments, data from laboratory systems that are modified to specifically investigate unique aspects of subseafloor microbial life can serve as useful proxies for specific physiological aspects of such microbes in situ. An organism\u2019s metabolic capabilities in the laboratory guide and constrain our understanding of its ability to adapt to specific environmental conditions.  Theme 3 builds on and complements the large and growing database of microbial community structure and metagenomic data from diverse subseafloor environments. By studying model subseafloor organisms in the laboratory, we expect to gain important, novel, and basic insights into physiological and metabolic features that are unique to microbes in the subseafloor. The overarching research objectives in this theme are to:   (3.1)   Isolate and characterize novel bacteria and archaea from diverse subseafloor habitats.  (3.2)   Examine fundamental physiology of subseafloor microbes under conditions of low growth rates and low energy flux.

In this setting, a volcanic crustal aquifer contains highly altered (suboxic to anoxic), warm (64 \u00b0C) hydrothermal fluids that are isolated from the overlying ocean in most locations by hundreds of meters of hemipelagic sediment and turbidites. Projects using data and field samples from this region have included two IODP expeditions (301 and 327); long-term borehole observatories (CORKs) used for testing, monitoring and sampling; and numerous non-drilling oceanographic expeditions using oceanographic ships and submersibles/ROVs, laboratory studies using materials and associated microbial cultures, and theoretical and computational experiments. Tools and methods developed for the JdF program have been adapted and applied at other sites, including other C-DEBI major program locations.\n\n\nThe JdF major program has contributed to training of numerous graduate and undergraduate students and other junior researchers, including those who add diversity to the STEM pipeline; has linked researchers and students from across the US and around the world, who work on common technical and scientific goals; and has comprised the basis for several successful education and outreach programs to the K-12 community and the public at large.\n\n\nMore specifically, the JdF major program has explored these and related questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the rates, directions, and distributions of fluid and coupled energy, solute, and microbial processes within the volcanic crustal aquifer?\n\n\nHow do microbial populations in the volcanic crust differ from location to location, and from those found in the overlying ocean and sediments?\n\n\nHow do microbial processes contribute to rock and fluid alteration?\n\n\n\n\nAnswering these and related questions will help to achieve goals important to Phase 2 of C-DEBI, within all three of the new program themes (Connectivity and Fluxes, Activities and Communities, Metabolism and Survival).\n\n\n These last two paragraphs feel like they should come before the bulleted questions and Phase 2 summary. \n\n\nThe JdF major program emphasizes a ridge-flank hydrothermal system that represents an important end-member in terms of crustal temperature, redox state, and through-put of fluids (and associated solutes, inoculum, etc). Results from this area are especially important in comparison to results derived from the NP and DO major programs. The latter is a system operating at much cooler and more oxic conditions, which may be characteristic of a large fraction of young and well-ventilated volcanic crust, whereas JdF is more typical in many ways of older sites where there is much more limited exposure of permeable basement rocks to the overlying ocean.\n\n\nThe JdF major program is also distinct for being the first at which controlled, cross-hole experiments have been completed, including the first tracer-injection experiment in the ocean crust.

With age, the valleys fill with sediment, but exposed basalt is commonplace, allowing seawater to ventilate and cool the crust.\n\n\nThe North Pond project was envisioned to investigate the origin, nature, and activity of microbial communities within basaltic basement below an isolated sediment \"pond.\" NP, which is located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22\u00b045'N and 46\u00b005'W and overlies 8Ma-old crust, was chosen in part because the site has been explored for decades. These exploratory studies have provided a geologic and hydrologic context for microbial studies.\n\n\nMost recently, subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were installed at NP during \nIODP Expedition 336\n (Sept. - Nov. 2011) to collect and monitor active, low temperature, oxygenated fluids that advect vigorously through basaltic basement and to take the first step in conducting manipulative experiments within this natural setting.\n\n\nThe three guiding questions for research at NP are:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the nature of microbial communities harbored in young ridge flanks and what is their role in ocean crust alteration?\n\n\nAre these communities unique, particularly in comparison with seafloor and sedimentary communities?\n\n\nWhere do deep-seated microbial communities come from (sediment, rock, seawater, other)?\n\n\n\n\nTo address these questions, and many more detailed ones, a team of international researchers undertook a site survey expedition prior to IODP Expedition 336, during which material was recovered (sediment and crustal rocks) and three borehole observatories were installed (CORKs). Five months later (April 2012) an ROV expedition deployed another observatory (CORK-Lite), collected fluids from the CORKs, deployed experiments, and recovered pressure data. A second ROV expedition in April 2014 collected more CORK fluids, recovered seafloor experiments, and deployed some additional ones. Much of the cost for this fieldwork was supported by our German colleagues, the IODP, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.\n\n\nResults completed this year from samples and data recovered during these four expeditions continue to shed light on all four Phase 1 C-DEBI themes.

Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth\u2019s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.\n\n\nOff the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) (\ncruise report\n). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.\n\n\nInstead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3\u00b0C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85\u00b0C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ (\ncruise report\n).\n\n\nFor a summary of recent accomplishments, see the \n2015 C-DEBI Annual Report\n\n\nDorado Outcrop Expedition History\n\n\nDecember 7 - December 23, 2013\n\n\nUNOLS Expedition AT26-09: \nDiscovery, sampling, and quantification of flows from cool yet massive ridge flank hydrothermal springs on Dorado Outcrop, eastern Pacific Ocean\n\n\nChief scientist:\n \nC.

            "text": "About one-third of the seafloor is underlain by oceanic crust that was formed at slow spreading ridges, resulting in seafloor morphology with many ridges and valleys (\u201cmountain ranges\u201d) that are roughly parallel to the spreading center. With age, the valleys fill with sediment, but exposed basalt is commonplace, allowing seawater to ventilate and cool the crust.  The North Pond project was envisioned to investigate the origin, nature, and activity of microbial communities within basaltic basement below an isolated sediment \"pond.\" NP, which is located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 22\u00b045'N and 46\u00b005'W and overlies 8Ma-old crust, was chosen in part because the site has been explored for decades. These exploratory studies have provided a geologic and hydrologic context for microbial studies.  Most recently, subseafloor observatories (CORKs) were installed at NP during  IODP Expedition 336  (Sept. - Nov. 2011) to collect and monitor active, low temperature, oxygenated fluids that advect vigorously through basaltic basement and to take the first step in conducting manipulative experiments within this natural setting.  The three guiding questions for research at NP are:   What is the nature of microbial communities harbored in young ridge flanks and what is their role in ocean crust alteration?  Are these communities unique, particularly in comparison with seafloor and sedimentary communities?  Where do deep-seated microbial communities come from (sediment, rock, seawater, other)?   To address these questions, and many more detailed ones, a team of international researchers undertook a site survey expedition prior to IODP Expedition 336, during which material was recovered (sediment and crustal rocks) and three borehole observatories were installed (CORKs). Five months later (April 2012) an ROV expedition deployed another observatory (CORK-Lite), collected fluids from the CORKs, deployed experiments, and recovered pressure data. A second ROV expedition in April 2014 collected more CORK fluids, recovered seafloor experiments, and deployed some additional ones. Much of the cost for this fieldwork was supported by our German colleagues, the IODP, and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.  Results completed this year from samples and data recovered during these four expeditions continue to shed light on all four Phase 1 C-DEBI themes. In addition, ongoing and planned research fit within the context of the three Phase 2 themes.  For a summary of recent accomplishments, see the  2015 C-DEBI Annual Report",

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 329 , led by Co-Chief Scientists Steven D\u2019Hondt and Fumio Inagaki, cored and logged deep-sea sediment and basaltic basement at seven SPG sites in 2010. Our present activity in this program focuses on post-expedition studies of samples and data from Expedition 329. The primary purposes of this project are to:   Document the nature of microbial communities and test the energetic limit to life in the most food-poor deep-sea sediment  Test the influence of basement age and sediment thickness on basement habitability, microbial communities, and the hydrologic evolution of crustal basalt.   This project addresses fundamental questions about subseafloor life, including the following:   Is there a lower limit to life in oligotrophic subseafloor sediment?  Are the communities in mid-gyre subseafloor sediments uniquely structured (how do these communities compare to those previously studied nearer to the continents)?  Is the primary electron donor organic matter from the surface world or hydrogen from  in situ  radioactive splitting of water?  Do microbial activities and composition vary with properties of the surface world, such as sea surface chlorophyll concentrations or organic flux to the seafloor?  Is microbial activity sustainable in subseafloor basalt by mineral oxidation ( e.g.,  oxidation of iron in the basaltic minerals) or other processes for tens of Myrs after basalt formation?   Answering these questions will help to achieve all three of the broader C-DEBI themes/objectives.  For a summary of recent accomplishments, see the  2015 C-DEBI Annual Report",

            "text": "The Dorado Outcrop program builds on decades of research that observed differences between measured and theoretical heat flow values in the ocean crust. Lister (1972) postulated that these differences resulted from the cooling of the crust by the circulation of seawater. The magnitude of this circulation is large, redistributing 10 TW (one fourth) of the Earth\u2019s heat loss. Then, in 1977, the first seafloor hydrothermal system was discovered; however, such systems, driven by the intrusion of magma, account for 20% of the total convective heat loss from oceanic crust. The remaining heat loss is transported on the ridge flanks at much cooler temperatures, yet with a net fluid flux that is commensurate with that of rivers. Given this magnitude of fluid flow, it has been postulated that even a minimal (1-5%) loss or gain from seawater-crustal exchange could impact global geochemical budgets in the ocean; however, until recently such a representative system had yet to be sampled.  Off the west coast of Costa Rica on 23 Ma-old crust lies the Dorado Outcrop, a small (0.5 km wide by 2 km long and 150 m high) basaltic outcrop that that trends southeast-northwest and is characteristic of typical ridge flank hydrothermal systems. In 2013 we surveyed DO using the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry and the remotely operated vehicle Jason II (AT26-09) ( cruise report ). Surveys generated a bathymetric map from which visual and thermal surveys located sites where crustal fluids vented and placed them within a geologic context. The outcrop consists of basaltic pillows and sheet flows with linear faults that are tens to hundreds of meters long and in the general trend of the outcrop. Surprisingly hydrothermal fluids do not currently vent from these linear features.  Instead, diffuse hydrothermal activity was identified from thermal anomalies determined from temperature probes mounted on the ROV and AUV. Such anomalies guided closer inspection with a manipulator-held device. Over one hundred thermal measurements were made with the warmest recorded temperature of 12.3\u00b0C, well above the bottom water temperature (1.85\u00b0C). Most of the hydrothermal flow occurred ubiquitously along the southwestern portion of the outcrop with the most vigorous site that spans hundreds of square meters (Marker K). In 2013, spring samples were collected and continuous fluid samplers (OsmoSamplers), and temperature loggers were deployed. Because of the diffuse nature of the springs, we developed a novel syringe-based fluid sampler that we used in 2014 with the submersible Alvin during which we recovered samplers and sensors, collected additional fluids, and measured dissolved oxygen in situ ( cruise report ).

Phase 2 of C-DEBI comprises a transition from dominantly exploration-based investigations to projects that balance discovery with hypothesis testing, data integration and synthesis, and ecosystem modeling.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nEach fellowship applicant will identify a primary advisor, who agrees to sponsor them and manage logistical aspects of their support (office and lab space, materials and supplies for conducting research). The graduate fellowship applicant must be a student in good standing who has been accepted into a graduate program. The primary advisor of all graduate student and postdoctoral fellows will be required to commit to meeting with the fellow to discuss research progress at least twice monthly and to provide means of allowing broader discussion about her or his research \u2013 this can be in the form of departmental seminars, group meetings, etc.\n\n\nThe primary advisor is also required to provide support for the fellow to attend an appropriate national meeting (e.g., AGU, ASM, ISME, ASLO, ISSM). Fellows are encouraged to go to the \nFall American Geophysical Union (AGU) Meeting\n in San Francisco as this is the major meeting that many C-DEBI participants attend. Fellows are expected to attend annual \nC-DEBI meetings\n supported directly by C-DEBI. \nThe advisor should include a statement agreeing to these points in their recommendation letter.\n\n\nSee our \ngraduate student and postdoctoral mentoring plan\n\n\nDuration and Renewal\n\n\nWe anticipate successful proposals to start 4/1/16 in alignment with our funding periodicity, however a delayed start date for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships is possible and will be a consideration in the review process. Graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships are available for a maximum of 2 years, depending on a successful evaluation near the end of year 1 of the fellowship. Fellows will submit a progress report on their achievements (2 pages maximum including any presentations given or papers published that can be listed separately), a one page summary of the proposed work for the second year and a letter of progress from the advisor to an ad-hoc oversight committee whose approval will be required for the release of the second year of fellowship funding.\n\n\nApplication and Submission\n\n\nThis call is now closed. We expect our next call to be due in 2017.\n\n\n\nGraduate Student Fellowship proposals\n should include:\n\n\n\n\nan institutional letter of intent\n\n\na short project summary of 100 words maximum written for a broad audience\n\n\na project description of not more than 3 pages (font size not smaller than 11 points) including a broader impacts statement and a data management plan\n\n\na \nseparate\n bibliographic reference section\n\n\na proposal implementation statement\n\n\na detailed budget and budget justification including institutional overhead, a NSF-style 2-page CV\n\n\na recommendation with statement of commitment from the anticipated fellowship advisor\n\n\na second faculty recommendation\n\n\nand (if applicable) the \nC-DEBI IODP Sample and Data Access Form\n.\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Fellowship proposals\n should include:\n\n\n\n\nan institutional letter of intent\n\n\na short project summary of 200 words maximum written for a broad audience\n\n\na project description of not more than 5 pages (font size not smaller than 11 points) including a broader impacts statement and a data management plan\n\n\na\nseparate\n bibliographic reference section\n\n\na detailed budget and budget justification including institutional overhead\n\n\na NSF-style 2-page CV\n\n\na recommendation with statement of commitment from the anticipated fellowship advisor\n\n\nthe names of 3 references\n\n\nand (if applicable) the \nC-DEBI IODP Sample and Data Access Form\n.\n\n\n\n\nDetails on submission components\n\n\nInstitutional Letter of Intent\n\n\n\n\nThe home institution's Sponsored Research Office must submit an institutional letter of intent indicating the official submission of the proposal and the contact at the institution who will be receiving the award on behalf of the institution.\u00a0 [\nDetails on the NSF award\n]\n\n\n\n\nProject Description\n\n\n\n\nInclude a description of the proposed research (statement of the problem, background and relevance to previous work, discussion of methodology and procedure to be followed, explanation of new or unusual techniques, and discussion of expected results, significance, and application) as well as a broader impacts statement (see below), and a brief plan for making data public and accessible in accordance with the \nC-DEBI Data Management Plan\n.\n\n\nThe research project should clearly be the applicant's own endeavor and should demonstrate the applicant\u2019s capability or potential for carrying out the project. Research goals should be realistic and attainable within the expected period of the fellowship. As necessary, the methodology section should also discuss any relevant pilot studies, projected numbers of samples, sampling strategies, and both limitations and strengths of the proposed techniques. Literature citations should be included throughout the proposal wherever appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts Statement\n\n\n\n\nThe Broader Impacts statement serves two purposes in our commitment to \nNSF\u2019s Broader Impacts Criterion\n: to further integrate research and education with a focus on early career professional development and to provide training to early career scientists in developing a Broader Impacts statement.

Since C-DEBI's inception in the fall of 2010, we have supported semiannual calls for proposals for our\u00a0\nResearch Grants\n, \nEducation Grants\n, and \nGraduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships\n. As we begin the second phase of our NSF Science and Technology Center award, our first call will be due 1/31/2016.\n\n\nWhat is the Source of C-DEBI Funding? Am I Eligible?\n\n\nC-DEBI is a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center administratively based at the University of Southern California (USC). Our Center is funded by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences (\nOCE award 0939564\n) Geosciences program (CFDA 47.050). The applicant's home institution must be a US institution able to receive NSF funding as a subaward from USC. The home institution's Sponsored Research Office must submit an institutional letter of intent stating the contact at the institution who will be receiving the award on behalf of the institution.\n\n\nC-DEBI values a diverse research environment and encourages proposals from applicants who would help to improve diversity in C-DEBI and STEM fields.\n\n\nWhat is the Frequency of the Proposal Calls?\n\n\nAs we begin the second phase of our NSF Science and Technology Center award, our first annual call will be due 1/31/2016.\n\n\nWho Develops the Proposal Calls?\n\n\nThe research calls are developed by the \nC-DEBI Executive Committee\n (ExCom). The education call is developed by the \nEducation Director\n.\n\n\nWhat are the Review Criteria?\n\n\nOnly research proposals that clearly articulate the relevance of the proposed work to C-DEBI \nresearch themes\n and are rated highly under scientific criteria are likely contenders for funding.\n\n\nSmall Grants and Fellowships Proposal Review Criteria\n\n\n\n\nAlignment and Relevancy with C-DEBI Phase II Goals and Themes\n\n\nPrimary aspect: How closely does the research topic align with C-DEBI goals?\n\n\nPrimary aspect: Is the relevancy particularly well articulated and connected to proposed activities?\n\n\nSecondary aspect: Does the proposed work correlate with research themes specifically mentioned in Phase II proposal?\n\n\nSecondary aspect: Have proponents not mentioned something that is highly relevant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill this project greatly advance our understanding of the deep subseafloor biosphere?\n\n\nHow qualified is the applicant to do this research?\n\n\nCan this project be completed in the time proposed?\n\n\nDoes this project rely on samples or data that are not yet in hand?\n\n\nDoes the proposal contain a clear statement that the samples/data are available and not in conflict with other planned or active research? (i.e. Are samples/data under moratorium? If so, has explicit permission been given to access the samples and/or data?)

The online toolkits kits were designed to be aligned with specific community college course subjects and include materials and information that instructors can use to make connections between the topics in their curriculum and C-DEBI research, practices, or technology.  Special Issue of  Current: The Journal of Marine Education  Featuring the Outreach of Marine NSF Science and Technology Centers \nA special issue of Current was sponsored by three National Science Foundation Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that focus on oceanography: C-DEBI, CMOP, and C-MORE. This issue published in 2013 introduces these STCs that focus on ocean and coastal environments and provides examples of their educational outreach. The C-DEBI articles include:   STCs Deliver New Oceanographic Concepts to Educators (PDF) ]  Microbes: Out of the Classroom and into the Field (PDF) ]  The \"Adopt-A-Microbe\" Project: A Multi-Disciplinary Science Curriculum for Middle School Students (PDF) ]  RETINA: Illuminating Elementary Scientists with STEM Modules (PDF) ]  Capitalizing on Expertise in Marine Education and Outreach to Broaden Impacts (PDF) ]   Adopt-A-Microbe (AAM) \nThe ship-to-shore Adopt-A-Microbe Project was created by Dr. Beth Orcutt (scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine) to raise awareness of microscopic life - \"microbes\" - living in the deep marine subsurface to middle school audiences while engaging them in the science of the ocean-drilling program. In collaboration with the Consortium for Ocean Leadership's Deep Earth Academy, the AAM project is being made into a stand-alone curriculum package to be used in the classroom, independent of whether an expedition is in progress at sea.

There were 16 in-person attendees and 2 people participating remotely. During the first part of the first day, each participant gave a short presentation on a research project or interest relevant to the subseafloor sedimentary biosphere. For the remainder of the first day and the second day, the participants engaged in group discussion of the following three questions about the deep subseafloor sedimentary biosphere: 1. What is known?\u00a02. What are the major questions?\u00a03. How can we go about answering these questions?\n\n\nRead the \nworkshop report\n\n\n2010-2014 Research Theme Team Workshops\n\n\nIn the initial phase of C-DEBI, the following four themes were the focus of C-DEBI research, providing a conceptual framework for scientific investigation supported by C-DEBI across a broad scientific community: \nActivity\n, \nExtent of Life\n, \nLimits to Life\n, and \nEvolution and Survival\n. For each of these themes, Theme Team Leaders regularly brought together experts within and outside of C-DEBI to identify new research directions within each theme. Based on these \u201cthink tank\u201d conversations, the Theme Team Leaders developed Requests for Proposals for the initial phase of C-DEBI small grants and fellowship programs.\n\n\nResearch Theme I. Activity in the Deep Subseafloor Biosphere: function \n rates of global biogeochemical processes\n\n\nTheme Team Leaders:\n Wiebke Ziebis (USC, 2010) \n Beth Orcutt (Bigelow, 2012-2014)\n\n\nWhat is the global consequence of microbial activity in the marine deep sediment and crustal biospheres? How quickly, or slowly, do processes occur, and what factors regulate these rates? What types of microbial processes are dominant in different environments, and why? What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.\n\n\nDownload the \n2012 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report\n, \n2013 Activity Theme Team Workshop Report\n, and read the \n2013 Activity Theme Review (Orcutt et al.)\n in Frontiers in Microbiology\n\n\nResearch Theme II. Extent of Life: biomes and the degree of connectivity (biogeography and dispersal)\n\n\nTheme Team Leader:\n Andreas Teske (UNC, 2010-2014)\n\n\nOver time, the interplay of microbial dispersal and environmental selection creates a distinct biogeography of microbes in the subseafloor. What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.\n\n\nDownload the \n2011 Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting Summary\n, \nGuaymas Basin IODP Pre-proposal (PDF, 9.4 MB)\n, and \n2013 joint Extent Theme Team and Guaymas Drilling Proposal Workshop Report\n\n\nResearch Theme III. Limits to Life: extremes and norms of carbon, energy, nutrient, temperature, pressure, pH\n\n\nTheme Team Leader:\n Tom McCollom (UC Boulder, 2010-2014)\n\n\nNumerous studies by C-DEBI participants and others continue to show that microbial life is widespread in the subseafloor. At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.\n\n\nDownload the \n2011 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report\n and \n2014 Limits To Life Theme Team Workshop Report\n\n\nResearch Theme IV. Evolution and Survival: adaptation, enrichment, and repair\n\n\nTheme Team Leaders:\n Bill Nelson (USC, 2010-2013) \n Julie Huber (2013-2014)\n\n\nReproduction, change, and selection are necessary elements of any evolutionary trajectory, but we know very little about evolution and adaptation in subseafloor habitats. What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes? How does lateral gene transfer impact evolutionary trajectories in the subseafloor? Through a combination of field and laboratory based measurements, C-DEBI research aims to examine these key questions about microbial evolutionary processes in the subseafloor.\n\n\nDownload the \n2011 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report\n, read the \n2012 Evolution Theme Review (Biddle et al.)\n in Frontiers in Microbiology and download the \n2013 Evolution Theme Team Workshop Report\n\n\n2009-2014 DEBI RCN (Research Coordination Network) Meetings\n\n\nWith the DEBI RCN, we held annual, theme-based meetings to address the research and coordination efforts of the growing deep biosphere community. These meetings enabled scientists and students to exchange ideas in deep biosphere studies, to learn about practical developments and study opportunities in the field, and to coordinate research and education activities. Each meeting was part \nscientific conference\n and part \ntraining workshop\n, both parts focused on a specific theme within deep biosphere research. These key themes included microbiology in sediments and basement rock, organic geochemistry and biosignatures, bioenergetics, hydrogeology, and drilling and sampling technology.\n\n\n2009 Subseafloor Ocean Biosphere and Borehole Observatory Science DEBI RCN Meeting (meeting report, PDF)\n\n\nOrganizers:\n Jim Cowen (UH), Brian Glazer (UH), Andrew Fisher (UCSC), Jan Amend (WUStL)\n\nCo-sponsored by USSSP\n\n\n2011 Deep Biosphere Sediment Microbiology DEBI RCN Meeting (meeting report, PDF)\n\n\nOrganizers:\n Andreas Teske (UNC), Jennifer Biddle (UDel), Matthew Schrenk (ECU)\n\nCo-sponsored by USSSP and NASA Astrobiology Institute\n\n\n2012 Ocean Crust Processes and Consequences for Life DEBI RCN Meeting (meeting report, PDF)\n\n\nOrganizers:\n Heiner Villinger, and Ulla R\u00f6hl, and Wolfgang Bach (all at U Bremen)\n\nCo-sponsored by German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German IODP at BGR\n\n\n2014 Bioenergetics and Subsurface Metabolisms DEBI RCN Meeting (meeting report, PDF)\n\n\nOrganizers:\n Jan Amend and Doug LaRowe (both at USC)\n\n\n2008 Kick Off Workshop\n\n\nOrganizers:\n Katrina Edwards and Beth Orcutt (both at USC)\n\n\nTHE WORKSHOP that started it ALL!!!

What are cell specific rates of activity in the marine deep biosphere? Through targeted support of research aiming to quantify geographic distributions of subseafloor sedimentary respiration, rates and magnitude of microbial crustal alteration, energy sources and carbon flow, C-DEBI enables robust analyses linking subseafloor processes to global scales and biogeochemical cycles.

What microbes take seed where and why? What are the most significant physical and chemical controls of these colonization processes? How similar or different are the resulting microbial ecosystems in the ocean crust and in deep sediment from each other and from the overlying deep ocean? By studying multiple sites and subseafloor habitats, C-DEBI research aims to develop a global model for biogeography of microbes below the seafloor.

At the same time, however, life is not everywhere, and where it does occur it appears to operate at very slow metabolic rates. How do environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, nutrient availability, fluid flow, pore space, etc. limit the distribution and metabolism of microorganisms in the deep subsurface? What defines the boundary where life can no longer exist in the deep subsurface? C-DEBI promotes investigations into the factors that limit the extent and activity of life in the deep subseafloor, including field, laboratory, and theoretical studies.

What are the metabolic drivers that might lead to selection in the subseafloor? In an environment where biomass turnover may occur on a timescale of hundreds to thousands of years, can you actually detect evolutionary changes?

Of course IODP provides the lion's share of the resources required to access the deep subseafloor, from deep-sea drilling platforms to installations of CORK observatories. IODP also provides a wealth of other opportunities for researchers, students and educators, including access to and development of other physical assets, networking with existing and new colleagues world-wide, professional scientific and leadership development and involvement in IODP's outstanding educational outreach programs. Initially, the IODP can appear to be an intimidating and unfathomable organization. However, with a few helpful hints and the encouragement of your friends, you should soon find yourself in the middle of a treasure-trove of valuable resources and opportunities.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nFor starters, check out the \nIODP webpage\n. It is vast and amazingly informative and fun to surf, but not all that easy to navigate with purpose. A first suggestion is to use your browser's \"Bookmark\" function liberally in order to quickly return to those pages that you find particularly important. Also, IODP maintains a \nIODP News mailing list\n; \nsubscribe here\n. Direct links to key IODP websites are noted below.\n\n\nGetting Involved in Expeditions\n\n\nA list of recent and upcoming expeditions, along with cruise information can be found at the \nIODP expeditions webpage\n. If you click on a particular expedition, you will find additional links to background information, \"Applications to sail\", \"Requests for samples/data\" and a plethora of other important related information.\n\n\nA researcher can be involved in an expedition as an on-board participant or as a shore-based participant. If you apply for and are chosen as either an on-board or shore-based participant, you will receive a series of instructive emails that will guide you through the participation process (e.g., necessary forms, on-board and post-cruise sample request procedures). Links to much of this information can be found through the \nexpeditions webpage\n. To apply to participate in an expedition, go to the \nIODP Apply to Sail webpage\n; then, if you will be affiliated with a U.S. institution at the time of the expedition, click on the \nUSA (USSSP) link\n and follow the application instructions. Application deadlines float with the timing of individual expeditions; they are announced on line and on the IODP News mailing list.\n\n\nThe Proposal Process\n\n\nYikes! But not as scary as it first seems; take it one step at a time and ask for advice from one of your experienced C-DEBI colleagues (e.g., Geoff Wheat, Andy Fisher, Steve D'Hondt, Katrina Edwards, Wolfgang Bach and others).\n\n\nThe level of required commitment from IODP determines the type and complexity of the proposal process. \nInformation on \"Drilling Proposals\"\n and \nspecific guidelines for developing IODP drilling proposals\n are available from the IODP website. Questions regarding proposals submission and proposal handling can be directed to the \nIODP-MI Science Coordinators\n.\n\n\nDrilling Project Proposals.\n Proposals to use one of IODP's drilling platforms are submitted to the IODP Management International, Inc. (IODP-MI). The process is rigorous; it is helpful to enlist experienced IODP PIs among your proposal proponents and to talk to other successful proposers. The process starts with a preliminary proposal, followed, if advised to do so by the Science Steering and Evaluation Panel (SSEP), by an extensive Full proposal. Check the guidelines (see web pages above) for submission deadlines.\n\n\nComplementary Project Proposals\n are scientifically motivated proposals having a commitment from a third party source of at least 70% funding for the platform operating costs of the expedition(s) arising from the proposal. The science operating costs and the remaining portion of the platform operating costs are the responsibility of the IODP. Complementary Project Proposals must satisfy normal Site Survey Panel (SSP) and Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP) requirements. Generally, Complementary Project Proposals are fast-tracked within the science advisory structure.\n\n\nAncillary Project Letters (APLs).\n APLs are short (5 pages) proposals for work requiring only 3 days or less of dedicated platform time, that would be ancillary to an expedition's primary project. Ancillary projects could involve drilling, logging, CORK installation and/or technician time, as well as a platform berth.\n\n\nParticipating in the IODP Advisory Structure\n\n\nParticipation in the U.S. Advisory Committee for Scientific Ocean Drilling (USAC) or the IODP Science Advisory Structure (SAS) is an invaluable way to learn about the IODP structure and proposal process, while both serving the scientific drilling community and keeping it informed of deep biosphere discoveries and issues.

The student would like to take action against this ethical misconduct. However, she does not want to be identified to anyone else in the C-DEBI community, or to her advisor. So, the student looks on the C-DEBI website and finds the number for the USC hotline. She calls it, explains her evidence to them, and then they contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel naming the advisor, but giving no information about the person who supplied the information.\u00a0The C-DEBI Ethics Panel discusses the complaint, and deems it worthy of further discussion with the Executive Committee.

            "text": "A student notices that her PhD advisor has knowingly placed figures and data produced by one of her advisor's previous postdocs into a new publication. There is no attribution in the authorship, acknowledgments, or citations for the postdoc\u2019s work. The postdoc's research had been funded by a C-DEBI fellowship. The student would like to take action against this ethical misconduct. However, she does not want to be identified to anyone else in the C-DEBI community, or to her advisor. So, the student looks on the C-DEBI website and finds the number for the USC hotline. She calls it, explains her evidence to them, and then they contact the C-DEBI Ethics Panel naming the advisor, but giving no information about the person who supplied the information.\u00a0The C-DEBI Ethics Panel discusses the complaint, and deems it worthy of further discussion with the Executive Committee. Together, the two committees agree that further clarification on the ethical complaint is necessary, so they contact the USC Office of Compliance to get further information from the student.",
