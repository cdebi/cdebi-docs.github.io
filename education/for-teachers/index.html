<p><strong>Community College Instructor Workshops</strong><br />
Los Angeles area community college instructors are invited to attend a day-long C-DEBI sponsored workshop at USC to learn about deep biosphere research being conducted by C-DEBI scientists and to collaborate with fellow instructors to integrate the information into their current curriculum. One workshop is held in each of the Fall and Spring semesters.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.mbari.org/earth/about.html">Education and Research: Testing Hypotheses (EARTH) Workshop</a></strong><br />
EARTH (co-sponsored by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, MBARI) is a week-long summer workshop for K-16 educators to incorporate real time data from ocean observatories to design and test outreach with the Internet as an interface to scientists, teachers, students, and the public.</p>
<p><strong>COSEE-West and College of Exploration Online Teacher Training Workshops</strong><br />
The West Coast Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE-West) and The College of Exploration teamed up with C-DEBI to develop connections and interactions between cutting edge university research and teacher-training workshops and training programs through lecture series and in-person and on-line workshops that enhance the teachers' instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Consortium for Ocean Leadership's School of Rock (SOR) Workshop</strong><br />
The School of Rock is for earth and ocean science educators interested in experiencing scientific ocean drilling research with the experts. During this multi-day workshop onboard the JOIDES Resolution or in the IODP Gulf Coast Core Repository, educators from across the country and the world work with real core material and lab technology to learn how the science reveals clues about Earth’s history.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/UHNAI/epo/alii.htm">NASA Astrobiology Laboratory Institute for Instructors (ALI'I) Workshop</a></strong><br />
The week-long ALI'I training course, designed for secondary science teachers, introduces the big picture of astrobiology before delving deeper to highlight specific contributions from cosmochemistry, heliophysics, astronomy, geosciences and microbial oceanography. The outer space of exoplanets and meteorites to inner space beneath the ocean floor on Earth will be used as the framework for promoting the Next Generation Science Standards. Besides lectures and state-of-the-art lab tours, there will be activities led by our University of Hawaii NASA Astrobiology Institute team scientists and ALI’I master teachers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/Educator-Small-Grant.docx">K-16 Educator Small Grants</a></strong><br />
The K-16 Educator Small Grants program supports K-16 teachers who have attended a C-DEBI educator training program and have incorporated C-DEBI content into their classrooms.  These awards up to $2500 support items including but not limited to the following: funds for student field trips, classroom supplies, travel for presenting C-DEBI curriculum at educator meetings, or additional professional development directly related to C-DEBI research.  Proposals for funding should indicate how C-DEBI research content is being translated into the classroom and how the proposed activities connect to that content. Applications are due <strong>May, 1, 2016</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.darkenergybiosphere.org/education-diversity/education-small-grants/">Education and Outreach Grants</a></strong><br />
Our education and outreach goals include creating distinctive, targeted education programs and promoting increased public awareness about life below the seafloor. C-DEBI is pleased to announce our Education and Outreach Grants (up to $50,000) are available to fund research or education/outreach projects on any area of marine deep biosphere topics. The program will fund the development of educational opportunities and materials that are pertinent to deep biosphere research in the subseafloor environment.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://joidesresolution.org/node/2998"><em>Where Wild Microbes Grow</em>: An eBook for Kids</a></strong><br />
<em>Where Wild Microbes Grow</em> is a children's picture eBook about the search for life under the seafloor. Kids explore how scientists are discovering amazing creatures that may help us find life on other planets. Written in rhyming verse by Kevin Kurtz and illustrated by Alice Feagan, this iBook also includes interactive videos, photos and other media about the astonishing world of seafloor microbes. Also available as a PDF that can be viewed on any computer device or printed.</p>
<p>Note: This eBook was also written to meet Common Core and Next Generation Science standards and uses text, illustrations, and videos to teach K-8 students about intraterrestrial life and the nature of science. Formatted for a digital projector or an interactive whiteboard in addition to iPads!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.coexploration.org/C-DEBI">C-DEBI Toolkits for Community College Instructors at the College of Exploration</a></strong><br />
To address the educational objectives of C-DEBI, the College of Exploration was funded to convene a collaborative team to guide the production of online toolkits of educational materials and resources that community college instructors could use to teach about C-DEBI research and the deep biosphere. The project team consisted of 8 to 10 collaborators, including community college instructors, C-DEBI scientists, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, technology experts, and science education specialists. The online toolkits kits were designed to be aligned with specific community college course subjects and include materials and information that instructors can use to make connections between the topics in their curriculum and C-DEBI research, practices, or technology.</p>
<p><strong>Special Issue of <em>Current: The Journal of Marine Education</em> Featuring the Outreach of Marine NSF Science and Technology Centers</strong><br />
A special issue of Current was sponsored by three National Science Foundation Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that focus on oceanography: C-DEBI, CMOP, and C-MORE. This issue published in 2013 introduces these STCs that focus on ocean and coastal environments and provides examples of their educational outreach. The C-DEBI articles include:</p>

The ship-to-shore Adopt-A-Microbe Project was created by Dr. Beth Orcutt (scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine) to raise awareness of microscopic life - "microbes" - living in the deep marine subsurface to middle school audiences while engaging them in the science of the ocean-drilling program. In collaboration with the Consortium for Ocean Leadership's Deep Earth Academy, the AAM project is being made into a stand-alone curriculum package to be used in the classroom, independent of whether an expedition is in progress at sea.
